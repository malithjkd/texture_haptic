Quick-start Instructions

Make and install driver

1) "make modules"
2) "sudo make install"
3) "modprobe s826"


Driver Installation Check:
1) "dmesg"
2) At the bottom of the log, you should see
   s826_probe
   s826 interrupt X installed (where X is any number)
   Sensoray 826 driver, version 1.0.4 successfully loaded.
3) Type "ls -al /dev/s826*".  You should see at least one entry for the 826. Eg:
   crw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 246, 0 Aug 17 09:09 /dev/s826_0

Make and run example console demo program

1) From this directory, type "make" or "make s826demo"
2) To run the demo, 
   "cd demo"
   "./s826demo"

  If the board has been changed to a different index (SW1), enter
  the board index as a parameter to ./s826demo.
  "./s826demo 1" for board index 1.

  If board not detected, please check the jumpers for the board index.
  Some earlier boards shipped with board index 15.  Please try board index
  15 if board not detected.

Libraries
- make lib32 (on 32-bit)
- make lib64 (on 64-bit)
- make lib (on either 32 or 64 bit if cross compile tools installed)

GUI demo
1) First make the libraries.   The source code for the libraries is provided,
   but needs installed.
   From this directory:

   "make lib"
   "sudo make lib_install"

to get the mono libraries
   "sudo apt-get install mono-complete"

to get the mono development environment
   "sudo apt-get install monodevelop"

to run the GUI (requires linux "mono" package)
   "cd demo_gui/app-826-csharp/app-826-csharp/bin/release"
   "mono app-826-csharp.exe"



Creating a custom program

All commands are in the file 826api.h

Please note. The source code for the libraries is provided, but it is not recommended to modify the library code (middleware directory).

Please see the programming manual for more details.

The demo program demo/s826_example.c provides several examples
of using the 826 API.
